# Todo List

**A simple, yet powerful, client-side To-Do list application built with vanilla JavaScript and Webpack.**<br>
**Part of The Odin Project, FullStack Javascript courses**

**[Live Demo](https://franchuphone.github.io/todo-list/)**

## 📖 Overview

The Todo List project is a straightforward web application designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. It provides a clean and intuitive interface for adding, tracking, and completing tasks, emphasizing simplicity and user experience. Built with modern web technologies, it serves as a robust example of a client-side application without a dedicated backend, suitable for personal task management or as a foundational project for further development.

## ✨ Features

-   🎯 **Add New Tasks**: Quickly add new to-do items to your list.
-   ✅ **Mark Tasks as Complete**: Toggle tasks between complete and incomplete states.
-   🗑️ **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list once they are no longer needed.
-   📝 **Task Display**: Clearly displays all active and completed tasks.
-   📅 **Due Dates**: Assign due dates to tasks, leveraging `date-fns` for robust date handling.
-   🔄 **Dynamic UI Updates**: Instantly reflect changes in the user interface without page reloads.
-   💾 **Local Storage Persistence**: Automatically save and load to-do data from the browser's local 

## 🔧 Future improvements

- 🎯 **Add colour to expired tasks**: quickly see if tasks are expired or not.
- 🎯 **Change tasks order**: list of tasks are currently ordered in a project by their creation date, not by their due date.
- 🎯 **Dynamic colour on menu elements**: change the colour of elements on lateral menu depending on their state (neutral, expired, achieved).
- 🎯 **Filter by date**: a click on a date will display all the tasks with the same due date.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
todo-list/
├── src/                # All application source code
├── package.json        # Project metadata and dependencies
├── package-lock.json   # Exact dependency versions
├── webpack.common.js   # Common Webpack configuration
├── webpack.dev.js      # Webpack configuration for development
└── webpack.prod.js     # Webpack configuration for production
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Webpack Configuration
This project uses Webpack for bundling. The configuration is split into three files:
-   `webpack.common.js`: Contains shared configuration for both development and production.
-   `webpack.dev.js`: Extends `webpack.common.js` with development-specific settings (e.g., `webpack-dev-server`).
-   `webpack.prod.js`: Extends `webpack.common.js` with production-specific optimizations (e.g., minification).

You can modify these files to adjust build processes, loaders, plugins, and output settings.

### Development Workflow
To contribute or further develop this project:
1.  Ensure all prerequisites are met and dependencies are installed.
2.  `npm run start` to open the application in development mode with live reloading.
3.  Make changes in the `src/` directory. Webpack will automatically recompile and refresh your browser.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Production Build
To create an optimized, minified build of the application for production:
```bash
npm run build
```
This command will output the production-ready static files into the `dist/` directory (as configured in `webpack.prod.js`), which can then be deployed to any static web hosting service.

### Deployment Options
The generated static files can be deployed using various methods:
-   **Static Hosting**: Services like Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or AWS S3. Simply upload the contents of the `dist/` folder.
